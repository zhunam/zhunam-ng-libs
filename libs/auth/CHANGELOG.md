Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `AuthUser` interface — minimal user shape (`uid`, `email`,
  `emailVerified`, `displayName`), no tokens/credentials/provider
  metadata.
- `AuthService` interface — base contract each provider entry point
  (`firebase/`, `supabase/`) must implement: reactive `currentUser` /
  `isAuthenticated` signals, `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`,
  `resetPassword`, `getIdToken`.
